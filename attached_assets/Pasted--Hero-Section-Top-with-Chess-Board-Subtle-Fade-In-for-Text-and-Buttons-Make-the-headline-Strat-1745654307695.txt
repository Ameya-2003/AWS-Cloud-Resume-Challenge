🏰 Hero Section (Top with Chess Board)
Subtle Fade-In for Text and Buttons:
Make the headline (Strategic Thinking, Calculated Execution) and the two buttons (About Me, View Projects) fade in sequentially with a slight upward motion.

Chess Board Animation:
Animate the chess pieces one after another on page load using a staggered animation — pieces can “drop” into place from above smoothly.

Hover Effect on Buttons:
Add a scale-up animation on hover for the buttons (About Me, View Projects) — very gentle, maybe 1.05x scaling.

📜 About Me Section
Text Slide-In on Scroll:
As users scroll to the About Me section, have the heading (About Me) and the paragraph content slide up and fade in.

Icon Count Animation:
The 5+, 30+, and 15+ stats can count up dynamically (starting from 0) when they appear in the viewport.

🏅 Certifications Section
Card Slide-In Animation:
Each certification card can slide up slightly and fade one after another using Anime.js timelines when the section comes into view.

Subtle Hover Interaction:
On hover, each certification card can gently lift up (translateY -5px) and cast a soft shadow for interactivity.

⚡ Skills Section
Staggered Icon Animation:
The skill icons (Frontend, Backend, DevOps, etc.) can pop in (scale from 0.8 to 1) staggered row by row when scrolling into view.

Hover Scale Effect:
On hover, slightly enlarge the skill icon and change the background color (like a light glow effect).

🧩 Projects Section
Timeline Style Appearance:
The heading (Projects) and the divider line can draw in (like an expanding underline) using Anime.js’s SVG line drawing.

Project Cards Fade and Slide:
As you scroll, each project card can fade in and slide upward slightly, staggered for better motion flow.

Button Animation (YouTube Channel Counter):
The yellow YouTube counter button (1.42k) could bounce lightly once when the user scrolls into this view — subtle but attention-grabbing.

✉️ Contact Me Section
Form Field Animation:
When the section scrolls into view, each input field (Name, Email, Message) can slide from left one by one.

Submit Button Hover Animation:
On hover, the Send Message button can have a pulse animation (increase opacity, slight growth).

🏁 Footer
Fade-In of Icons:
The LinkedIn and GitHub icons at the bottom can fade in from bottom slowly, maintaining elegance.

📋 General Site-Wide Additions
Smooth Scroll Animations:
Transition between sections smoothly when clicking navigation links (using easeInOutQuad easing).

Scroll Progress Bar:
Thin progress bar at the very top of the page that fills up based on scroll — using Anime.js utilities.

Subtle Background Chess Pattern Animation:
The faint chess background could have a very slow, almost unnoticeable parallax movement to bring life to the background.
