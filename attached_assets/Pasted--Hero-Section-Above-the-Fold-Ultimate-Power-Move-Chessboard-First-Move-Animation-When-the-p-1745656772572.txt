🌟 Hero Section (Above the Fold) — Ultimate Power Move
Chessboard "First Move" Animation:
When the page loads, one chess piece (like a pawn) actually moves forward (1-2 tiles).
Not just a drop-in — a micro-movement using Anime.js's path motion feature.
→ Like simulating a real chess game's first move!

Glowing Strategic Thinking Title:
Animate the words Strategic Thinking to glow and pulse softly, using text-shadow manipulation over time.

Scroll-Triggered "Reveal the Board" Effect:
When scrolling from the hero down, have the chessboard disintegrate into particles and "fly away" (controlled burst via Anime.js timelines).

🏆 Certifications Section — The Golden Trophy Effect
Certificate Cards Flip on Hover:
The entire certification card flips like a playing card (3D rotation around Y-axis) showing a "fun fact" or a trophy emoji behind it.

Badge Award Animation:
When the user scrolls to the section, certifications drop from the top like medals swinging slightly before settling into place.

🛡️ Skills Section — Dynamic Skill Showdown
Skill Icons Clash Animation:
As you hover over each skill (AWS, Docker, Kubernetes), they could briefly "vibrate" like two chess knights clashing — a fast, slight shake or bounce, then settle.

Skill Progress Meter:
Show animated "mastery" bars behind each skill with a filling effect (0% → 100%) when it comes into view.

🎯 Projects Section — Targeted Focus
Spotlight on Hover:
When a project card is hovered over, dim the rest of the screen very slightly and highlight the hovered card with a soft spotlight.

Animated Tags:
The project tags (AWS, DevOps, etc.) pulse gently one by one when a card is revealed.

Mini Project Timeline Scroll:
Create a horizontal scrolling timeline of your projects that auto-scrolls slowly, but pauses when you hover.

📩 Contact Me Section — Magical Connection
Envelopes Flying In:
Animate a bunch of tiny envelopes flying in the background when users land on the Contact section.

Button Morphing:
When you click Send Message, the button morphs into a flying paper airplane and zooms off the screen (then returns to normal).

🌌 Site-Wide Effects — Galactic Touch
Dynamic Background Stars (Parallax Chess Stars):
Softly animated tiny golden chess-piece icons floating in the background, moving at different speeds based on scroll (parallax effect).

Thematic Loading Animation:
If you want a small loading screen, show a chess knight spinning while the site loads, then it jumps away once loading completes.

Scroll-Snap + Section Scaling:
As you scroll, sections "snap" into place and slightly zoom in to give a high-end, smooth feeling.

🔥 "Secret Sauce" Animation (Pure Bragging Rights)
Chess Timeline Reveal (Special Easter Egg):
Create a hidden button or gesture — if clicked, the chess board breaks into a timeline showing your resume experience step-by-step, like a chess match progression (e.g., Pawn to E4 → Started AWS certification → Knight to F3 → Deployed cloud app).
